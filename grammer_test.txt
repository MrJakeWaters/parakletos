Lord, help me to live by the Spirit particularly now that times are more challenging.  It is good that I am tested so that I can show my love for you through perserverance and dependence on you.  Without you I cannot and do not want to live. Give me the strength to push through these times.  I want to encourage others and lead them to you b/c without you there is nothing worth living for.  Come Holy Spirit and guide your servant.  Lead me to your will and to the love you have for me.  Bless mom for her faithfulness and bless all the activity I hcoming up.  Camping with Tim, traveling with Natalie and my nephews, staying with mom, my potential move, my work on this app.  JAmes says in your word that you give wisdom freely to all who ask, help to me ask rightly, and give me wisdom for the days to come.  Forgive my confusion and uncertainty I just don't know what to do with so many things.  Perhaps I'm letting the devil confuse me.  Speak truth to me Father.  All this I pray in Jesus name, Amen
