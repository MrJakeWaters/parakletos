Lord, help me to live by the Spirit particularly now that times are more challenging.  It is good that I am tested so that I can show my love for you through perserverance and dependence on you.  Without you I cannot and do not want to live. Give me the strength to push through these times.  I want to encourage others and lead them to you b/c without you there is nothing worth living for.  Come Holy Spirit and guide your servant.  Lead me to your will and to the love you have for me.  Bless mom for her faithfulness and bless all the activity I hcoming up.  Camping with Tim, traveling with Natalie and my nephews, staying with mom, my potential move, my work on this app.  JAmes says in your word that you give wisdom freely to all who ask, help to me ask rightly, and give me wisdom for the days to come.  Forgive my confusion and uncertainty I just don't know what to do with so many things.  Perhaps I'm letting the devil confuse me.  Speak truth to me Father.  All this I pray in Jesus name, Amen

I'm frustrated again.  Perhaps your teaching me perservance.  I just know I'm a senior data engineer but I can't get through these interviews.  At least I haven't been able to yet.  I'm insulted that amazon is going to pretend that I'm not at that level and it just makes me want to leave.  Forget them, this is dumb and their processes are so broken and bad at evaluation and the people in charge are perfect examples of this. Nothing I can do now.  I guess I just need to keep studying and keep working until it's super obvious in any interview.  This whole process has showed me that I am better than I thought.  Regardless I need to be able to interview, well to get a big time job.  I also need more work experience and good project demonstration. Just guide me to the right opportunities.  And Lord, let you will, not mine be done.  I just feel kinda stuck and frustrated and in a lot of ways.  I feel like you're trying to produced this for me with dating but there's big differences in my skills as an engineer and dating.  Plus work actually pays you, dating doesn't. I just don't want to work at being better at dating.  I just want to get a different job at a different company that I enjoy more and not deal with women.  I kinda don't think I want a family.  I feel it's 100% too late for it to be worth it. I don't want to go to Nashville and I don't want to work at Amazon.  I don't want to sell my house.  I don't know anything.  I'm just feeling a little down about not doing as good I could on the interview. Not my will but yours be done Lord.  Hard for me to process since I do think that you'll do whatever you want regardless. But are you Lord or are you an advisor or something.  You are Lord.  You are Lord of all that is and it's a bit silly to not submit to it.  You are trustworthy I just am selfish and lazy.  I just want to work remote and not deal with any of this but such is life.  It doesn't come without struggles but I have you.  Sometimes I think I take it for granted.
