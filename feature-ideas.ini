features: 
	- ideas
		- data model for prayer list
		- bibleapi call directly for bible info
			- also incorporate daily bible chapter
		- Words of Jesus are output in Red for verse (general interesting output formatting for bible verses, other ideas could spin off)
		- refine accuracy of text autocorrection or add feature that allow JLine  vim line correction functionality (haven't been able to get JLine to work well with it's features)
		- use NLP to attache bible verses and chapters to journal entries or prayer lists (Apache Open NLP https://opennlp.apache.org/docs/2.5.4/manual/opennlp.html#intro.description)
		- advanced grammer and syntactical corrections for journal entries (potentially api webhook but don't want to spend the money and want to keep things lean)
		- add pager functionality to listing journal entries
		- display hierachry of how bible verses connect to one another (potentially should be another app), maybe with graph database
		- add selecting bible version as a part of the configuration
			- need to probably save bibles in some kind of format to do this to be able to add new versions
		- encrypt all journal entries
		- allow for multiple password protected journals for multipler users (under consideration, might not be worth the effort)
		- allow people to send prayers to other users
			- prayers can be sent anonymously, identifiable through account, or identifiable through country/region
			- people can configure prayers to be readable or just an unreadable message that says others are praying
		- allow for users to request for prayers to followers or something similiar, have to think about how that would work
		- attach songs or albums for encouragement based off journal entries
