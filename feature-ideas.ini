		- advanced grammer and syntactical corrections for journal entries (potentiall api webhook but don't want to spend the money and want to keep things lean)
		- add pager functionality to listing journal entries
		- text autocomplete for workflows for given commands
		- display hierachry of how bible verses connect to one another (potentially should be another app), maybe with graph database

		- encrypt all journal entries
		- allow for multiple password protected journals for multipler users (under consideration, might not be worth the effort)
