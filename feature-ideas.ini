features: 
	- to do
		- delete/archive prayers (I don't think we can delete them b/c then what do we do with the references to old prayers in the journal entries?... So we will archive them)
			- refactor for one archived folder and one active folder for prayers
		- add help menu and description to command
		- add pager functionality to listing journal entries first (then extend to other commands like reading scripture verse and prayer lists)
		- return prayer list in alphetical order of person and timestamp of prayer (oldest to newest)
		- setup ai api based historical contexts for bible verses and chapter outputs
		- encrypt all journal entries
		- add commentary data model
	- ideas
		- leverage crossway.org resources in some way
		- Words of Jesus are output in Red for verse (general interesting output formatting for bible verses, other ideas could spin off)
		- refine accuracy of text autocorrection or add feature that allow JLine  vim line correction functionality (haven't been able to get JLine to work well with it's features)
		- use NLP to attache bible verses and chapters to journal entries or prayer lists (Apache Open NLP https://opennlp.apache.org/docs/2.5.4/manual/opennlp.html#intro.description)
		- advanced grammer and syntactical corrections for journal entries (potentially api webhook but don't want to spend the money and want to keep things lean)
		- display hierachry of how bible verses connect to one another (potentially should be another app), maybe with graph database
		- allow for multiple password protected journals for multipler users (under consideration, might not be worth the effort)
		- allow people to send prayers to other users
			- prayers can be sent anonymously, identifiable through account, or identifiable through country/region
			- people can configure prayers to be readable or just an unreadable message that says others are praying
		- allow for users to request for prayers to followers or something similiar, have to think about how that would work
		- attach songs or albums for encouragement based off journal entries
